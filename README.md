## Detailed Description
This is a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:

Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception applies unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,

The number 13 is replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
The number 21 is replaced with "Boop".
The number 32 is replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

## The projects objectives were to complete the following (MVP)
- JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- Tests are included for each behavior and code is committed after each test passes.
- Application implements a loop and works as expected.
- The user can use the application repeatedly and see new results.
